description=Extract real-world objects from satellite imagery with Mapflow by Geoalert. Mapflow provides AI mapping pipelines for building footprints, roads, fields, forest and construction sites.
about=Mapflow provides AI models for automatic feature extraction from satellite imagery. Choose a web imagery provider or upload you own image, select what type of features you want to extract and your area of interest, and Mapflow will do the rest. Currently, we can extract:
        - buildings
        - agricultural fields
        - forest (optionally, with height)
        - roads
        - construction sites
